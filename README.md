# neural_practice
Some code in this repo is inspired from classic neural network examples and from traversy medias youtube video on neural networks, this is purely practice. so it turns out if i have to array of objects and combine them into into one warray without alternating the objects the netwrork is reinforced on whatever type it saw last, the baby names may be a failed project if I dont alternate, however I learned alot by using google sheets I created an api of sorts. Method was loop and identify lists on a page, use google sheets and the importhtml function to find the list i want and import it into the spreadsheet where I can use different functions to make the data like this "data", so altogether it makes up one giant array, then map over that array and create an array of objects
