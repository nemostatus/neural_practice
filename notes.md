im not sure if it works because it classifies grtgerggergrgergerferfgergergergergergergergergergergergergergergeergergergergergergergergergergergergregergergregregre as a popular name ... It is only 50 iterations.. maybe increase iterations and see if still read as popular, If it still is Im not sure what else to do to train the neural network, however shuffling the training data did make a difference and actually has 2 different outputs now.
